# MCP Toolkit

**Manage your AI tools the way you work.**

MCP Toolkit helps you organize Model Context Protocol servers at the project level. Use different API keys for different clients, customize tool access per project, and keep everything organized in one clean desktop app.

---

## Features

🎨 **Visual Interface** - Manage your MCP servers through a clean desktop interface instead of editing JSON files.

🔗 **Project-Based Organization** - Connect MCPs to specific projects with independent configurations and environment variables.

🔐 **Secure Secrets** - Keep your API keys and credentials encrypted with AES-256-GCM encryption.

🌐 **Universal Support** - Works with Claude Desktop, Cursor, VS Code, Codex, and any MCP-compatible tool.

---

## How It Works

**1. Create Projects** - Organize your codebases into projects with isolated configurations.

**2. Add MCP Servers** - Import your existing servers or add new ones (supports Docker, Binary, and HTTP).

**3. Configure Bindings** - Connect servers to projects and customize environment variables as needed.

**4. Integrate** - Point your AI tool to MCP Toolkit and you're ready to go.

## Getting Started

**Installation**

Download the latest release for your platform (Windows, macOS, or Linux) and install the application.

**Configuration**

Add MCP Toolkit to your AI tool's configuration. Here's an example for Claude Desktop:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp-toolkit": {
      "command": "mcp-toolkit",
      "args": []
    }
  }
}
```

> **Note**: The command path may vary depending on your installation location. On macOS, this is typically `/Applications/MCP Toolkit/mcp-stdio`.

Once configured, open MCP Toolkit and start managing your servers.

## Development

If you'd like to contribute or run the project locally:

```bash
pnpm install        # Install dependencies
pnpm tauri dev      # Start development server
pnpm tauri build    # Build for production
```
